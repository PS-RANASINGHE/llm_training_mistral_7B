It enables seamless integration with SCADA systems, PLCs, RTUs, and industrial sensors, ensuring encrypted data transmission over a VPN-secured connection. The Tosibox 175 acts as a secure communication gateway, allowing real-time retrieval and control of operational parameters such as voltage levels, pressure, flow rate, temperature, and machine status from Modbus-enabled devices. It is particularly suited for smart factories, remote energy management, and critical infrastructure applications, where secure and reliable data access is paramount. By leveraging end-to-end encryption, the Tosibox 175 ensures that Modbus data remains protected against cyber threats, mitigating risks associated with unauthorized access and industrial espionage. It supports both static and dynamic IP addressing, enabling deployment in environments where network conditions are unpredictable. The device\u2019s built-in firewall and NAT (Network Address Translation) functionality provide additional layers of security by restricting unauthorized access to Modbus devices while allowing controlled remote management. The Tosibox 175's ability to function as an edge gateway enhances its role in Industrial IoT (IIoT) and Industry 4.0 applications, where it facilitates secure data acquisition from Modbus devices and transmits it to cloud-based analytics platforms for predictive maintenance and real-time decision-making. In a typical industrial scenario, the Tosibox 175 can be deployed in a remote water treatment plant, where it collects real-time data from Modbus-based pH sensors, turbidity meters, and flow controllers, transmitting the data to a central SCADA system. Engineers can use the Tosibox VPN tunnel to remotely adjust pump flow rates, set operational parameters, and conduct diagnostics on PLCs without requiring physical presence. Its robust industrial design, featuring DIN rail mounting, surge protection, and extended temperature range (-35\u00b0C to +75\u00b0C), makes it suitable for harsh industrial environments. The Tosibox 175\u2019s automatic reconnection (TosiOnline) ensures that the connection remains stable even in case of temporary network failures, minimizing downtime and ensuring continuous monitoring."}

{"input": "What is Remote Matching?", "output": "Remote Matching is an alternative way to match the first master Key to a new Lock/Node or Virtual Central Lock (HUB). In Remote Matching, the Key does not have to be physically connected to a Lock/Node. but it uses a unique, cryptographic code instead."}
{"input": "When is Remote Matching useful?", "output": "This can be useful e.g. if the Lock/Node needs to be reset and the master Key is not available in the same place. With Virtual Central Lock (HUB), remote matching is the only way to match it with a master Key."}
{"input": "What happens during the Remote Matching process?", "output": "The process is begun by generating the remote matching code on the Lock/Node that shall be matched, which enables remote matching on the Lock/Node with that code only. Then, the remote matching wizard is opened on the master Key software and the code is entered there. Next, the devices will establish a trust relationship over the Internet, after which the process is completed and the Lock/Node appears on the master Key as after physical matching."}
{"input": "What happens after Key and Lock/Node are matched?", "output": "After the Key and Lock/Node are matched, the devices can be used normally, and the Master Key can for example create Backup Keys, Sub keys or Mobile Clients and connect Locks/Nodes together."}
{"input": "What should you do to keep the Remote Matching code safe?", "output": "Note: make sure to keep the code safe when transferring it to the master Key as anybody who knows the code can match the Lock/Node and connect to it.

The technology is based on globally acknowledged information encryption standards, secure user authentication, automatic security updates and simplifying often complex technology."}
{"input": "What is Tosibox key?", "output": "Tosibox Key is an intelligent USB-connected device that contains a secure crypto-processor. The Key is used to establish a secure connection to the edge Node. All Tosibox Keys and edge Nodes are interoperable. Tosibox Key can be a Master Key that is the top authority to manage the network access rights for other Key user. Key users can be software only Keys, hardware Keys or Mobile Client users. Tosibox Node is a device that accepts remote connections from Keys and creates private and secure access to connected network devices. The network devices that are connected to the Node´s LAN port are automatically discovered. Node can also be connected together to expand a single network to multiple sites. When connecting two Nodes to each other, one must be in Sub Lock mode of operation where the Node is a subordinate to its master Node. Tosibox HUB is a VPN tunnel concentrator that maintains always-on VPN connections towards Tosibox Nodes and provides centralized user and network management."}
{"input": "What is Device Identities", "output": "Tosibox products identify each other by cryptographic pairing in which the products are matched with each other before use. This is achieved locally by connecting the Tosibox Node with the user Key physically, or remotely by generating the Remote Matching Code on the device that is to be matched."}
{"input": "What happens during the physical matching process?", "output": "In the physical matching process, the Key device is inserted into the USB port of the edge Node. In Remote Matching the device that is to be matched generates a cryptographic code that can be entered in the Key SW. In the matching process, the edge Node and Key exchange public key of the keypair with each other to create a mutual trust relationship. The encryption key is stored in a closed memory location of the crypto processor on the Key device. The encryption key is protected with a password even if you lose the Key device. The encryption key cannot be copied or tampered with by outsiders. Establishing a remote connection to the edge Node is impossible without the correct encryption key."}
{"input": "Key Connection", "output": "Every user Key uses either a bridged Layer 2 or a routed Layer 3 connection. The Layer 2 connection type means that the edge Node is essentially in the same network with the user that it is bridged to. A Layer 3 creates a routed connection where the Lock and User have their own IP networks. The bridged Key connection allows access only to a specific LAN network and the Locks bridged to it. The routed Key connection allows the selection of multiple LAN networks, Locks and other targets that are accessible for the Key."}
{"input": "How does Tosibox establish VPN connections?", "output": "Typically, Tosibox edge Node and Key can establish the VPN connection directly between each other using the UDP protocol. There are, however, some cases where this is not possible, for example when outbound UDP is blocked in the firewall, or a proxy server must be used. In these situations, the VPN connection is established using a fallback mechanism using the TCP protocol, with the help of a relay server. The relay server is a Tosibox maintained router on the Internet that re-routes the encrypted VPN data between the connection end points. At no point is the data decrypted at any server because the connections are still end-to-end authenticated and encrypted."}
{"input": "Why should outbound UDP connections be allowed in the firewall?", "output": "Because of the latencies between Tosibox products and the relay servers, the nature of the TCP protocol, and server capacity, relayed connections may not provide as good performance as direct UDP connections. To avoid this situation and to ensure the best performance, all outbound UDP connections should be allowed in the firewall."}
{"input": "Remote Connection", "output": "Tosibox edge Node and Key identify each other reliably over the Internet because of the matching connection described previously. This unique and patented method by Tosibox creates the connection securely and automatically even through firewalls and NATs. The connection doesn’t require any inbound ports to be permanently open on the firewall. Required outbound ports are listed in the table at the end of this document."}
{"input": "Key - Node connection establishment steps", "output": "1. Key and edge Node register themselves to the MatchMaker service. The connection between the MatchMaker and TOSIBOX devices is encrypted using TLS and mutually authenticated using certificates and PKI 2. User initiates the Key software to request a connection to the edge Node. MatchMaker service listens for connection requests and redirects the connection parameters to the respective end points 3. VPN tunnel is mutually authenticated between the Key software and the edge Node using certificates and PKI 4. VPN tunnel is established directly between the Tosibox edge Node and Key. The connection is end-to-end authenticated and encrypted. Encryption and decryption take place at the connection end points"}
{"input": "How to access Tosibox devices remotely over the Internet", "output": "The only way to access Tosibox devices remotely over the Internet is by using the private, secure and encrypted VPN connection that TOSIBOX creates. Having Tosibox secure connection to the remote site does not cause data security issues to the users or the remote network if the software is kept up to date and access control and system settings are reviewed and maintained systematically."}
{"input": "How are Tosibox HUB and edge Node configuration UIs protected?", "output": "Tosibox HUB and edge Node configuration UIs are protected from unauthorized users with a username/password. Login is possible only over VPN connection if accessing from the internet or via private LAN side."}
{"input": "What does Tosibox Key provide for remote access?", "output": "Remote access to the network requires Tosibox Key and explicit access rights granted by the network administrator. Tosibox Key provides 2-Factor Authentication, the Key hardware device and a user defined password for login."}
{"input": "Local connection in Tosibox", "output": "Tosibox edge Node and user Key can also be used in closed, high security networks to further protect critical systems. In closed networks the Tosibox products connect directly to each other without the need of an internet connection. In addition, connection made outside the network as well as remote connections originating from outside of that closed network can be blocked. This feature is called Local Connection."}
{"input": "Mobile Client Security", "output": "Tosibox Mobile Client for Android and for iOS also adheres to the same high security standards and builds on the physical security foundation of Tosibox. Access rights are granted and controlled from the physical Key device, keeping the Key owner always in control – even if the mobile device would get lost. The Mobile Client utilizes a two-factor authentication scheme where the security credentials are tied to the physical mobile device. The application cannot be copied to or used on another device. Additionally, it is possible to prevent access from Mobile Clients completely per edge Node by the administrator."}

Devices like the Key and Lock exchange security certificates when matched physically or remotely, creating a trust relationship. The VPN connection is mutually authenticated and encrypted between the Key and the Lock using TLS and PKI. This ensures that the data is encrypted end-to-end, with no intermediate servers decrypting the data."}
{"input": "How to take extra Keys into use", "output": "Backup keys and Sub Keys can be serialized to Locks using the Tosibox Key software. Backup key is essentially a copy of a Master Key and can access all locks serialized by the Master Key and vice versa. However, Sub key access rights given to a master Key are not copied to Backup Key as only the original Master key can give the rights to these locks. Sub Key can access only locks it has been given access rights to by the Master Key. New Keys cannot be made using a Sub Key. Soft Keys are virtual versions of Sub Keys."}
{"input": "How to take SoftKey into use", "output": "To activate SoftKey on a PC or Mac, you will need: 1. SoftKey license for the master Key. 2. Key SW v3.0.0 or later both on the master Key and the client computer, download from https://www.tosibox.com/tosibox-key. Activation involves generating an activation code on the master Key, sending it to the end user, who then activates the SoftKey client. Once activated, you can define access rights and start using the SoftKey to connect to Locks."}
{"input": "What is Lock mode?", "output": "In Lock Mode, the Lock acts as a combined router/firewall on the network. The Lock is connected to the Internet via its WAN port or a 4G modem. It creates its own protected local network for the connected devices. Devices that are connected to the Lock by cable or via WLAN access point are accessible with the Key."}
{"input": "What is Client mode?", "output": "In Client Mode, the Lock acts as a client, not as a router/firewall. It provides secure remote access to the network but does not protect devices connected to the same LAN. The Lock is connected to an existing network like any other device and provides remote users access to other devices in the network. The Lock can be considered as a network switch, not routing traffic between WAN and LAN."}
{"input": "What is the difference between Lock mode and Client mode?", "output": "Lock Mode creates its own protected local network and acts as a router/firewall, whereas Client Mode connects to an existing network and acts as a client, providing remote access but not network protection."}
{"input": "What are the requirements to set the Lock in Client mode?", "output": "In Client mode, the Lock must be connected to the network through a LAN port. The WAN port is not used in Client Mode. The Lock must have a fixed IP address or DHCP Client configuration, and NAT can be enabled."}
{"input": "What should I check if my Key can't connect to Lock?", "output": "If you can't see Lock in Key user interface or if Lock is red, check these: 1. Key has Internet connection. 2. Key is serialized to Lock. 3. Lock has Internet connection."}
{"input": "What if the Lock is yellow in the Key software user interface but I can't connect to it?", "output": "If the Lock is yellow in Key user interface but you cannot connect to it, check the following: 1. Layer 2 Key needs to have assigned IP address or at least Lock's DHCP server on. 2. Firewall does not block the connection."}
{"input": "What if the connection still doesn't work after checking the above points?", "output": "If the connection still doesn't work, try using a different Internet connection for Key. If that still doesn't resolve the issue, enable remote support for Lock and contact Tosibox Support."}
{"input": "When to use Layer 2 or Layer 3?", "output": "Tosibox remote connections support two different connection types: Layer 2 (bridged) and Layer 3 (routed). Layer 2 connection creates a virtual network interface that appears to be residing in the remote network, where each remote user gets its own address from the remote network. It works on the data link layer (MAC). Layer 3 connection has tunnel end points with private addresses, and data is routed to the remote network via the remote end of the tunnel. Traffic in the remote network appears to be coming from the Lock device without needing additional addresses. It works on the network layer (Internet Protocol)."}
{"input": "What are key connections for Layer 2?", "output": "Use Layer 2 when the application uses a non-IP protocol on top of Ethernet (e.g. Profinet or IPv6), the application relies on broadcast functionality (e.g., in discovery of certain IP cameras), or when connections originating from Lock’s network to the Key computer are needed."}
{"input": "What are key connections for Layer 3?", "output": "Use Layer 3 when allocating an IP address for each remote user from the remote network is not desired, when connecting to a Central Lock that has Layer 3 connections to Locks, or when the Lock has 1:1 NAT enabled and connections should use the translated addresses. Layer 3 is usually more efficient and less prone to DHCP problems."}
{"input": "What is a HUB – Lock connection?", "output": "When serializing a Lock to a HUB, the connection type can be chosen between Layer 2 (Sub Lock) and Layer 3 (Lock). Layer 3 (Lock) connection is recommended in most HUB deployments as it scales better. Any Key with Layer 3 connection type that can connect to the Central Lock can also connect to devices behind Layer 3-connected Locks. Layer 2 (Sub Lock) connection requires that keys connect through the HUB, and the devices behind the Sub Lock will access the Internet via the HUB."}
{"input": "How can I install the Tosibox Mobile Client on Android?", "output": "You can download and install the Tosibox Mobile Client from Google Play using the following link: https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.tosibox.mobileclient. Alternatively, you can visit https://www.tosibox.com/for-user-tosibox-mobileclient for more information."}
{"input": "What is 1:1 NAT on Lock?", "output": "Network address translation (NAT) is a method of remapping one IP address space into another by modifying network address information in the IP header of packets while they are in transit across a traffic routing device. It allows using the same IP address range in multiple sites and remapping the addresses in Locks so that the sites appear to have different addresses on the Key side. One-to-one NAT maps one LAN device address to another."}
{"input": "When should you use NAT?", "output": "NAT should be used when you need to connect multiple sites simultaneously and cannot configure each site individually. This occurs when the same IP addresses are used in each site, causing connection issues. The solution to this is 1:1 NAT, which can resolve IP address conflicts and allow simultaneous connections."}
{"input": "How do you configure NAT on the Lock?", "output": "To configure NAT, open the Lock's management interface and log in as an admin. Go to Network > LAN, then select the 'Use translated addresses with remote access (1:1 NAT)' checkbox. You can configure the translated address or let the Lock decide. After saving the settings, the Lock will disconnect remote access and reconfigure your workstation."}
{"input": "What is the 'Lock in Lock mode' configuration?", "output": "In Lock mode, NAT is configured through Network > LAN settings. For example, if the Lock's LAN IP is 10.15.6.1 with a netmask of 255.255.255.0, and a device on that network is 10.15.6.2, enabling NAT will allow the Lock to designate a new NAT IP network address (e.g., 10.1.1.0). From the Key side, the Lock user interface can be accessed via the NAT IP (e.g., 10.1.1.1), and LAN devices will use NAT addresses."}
{"input": "What is the 'Lock in Client mode' configuration?", "output": "In Client mode, NAT can be configured through the Lock's Network > LAN settings. This mode does not use a physical WAN connection, only a physical LAN connection. DHCP on the LAN won't work, only static IP addressing is supported. You must assign a static IP address, subnet, gateway IP address, DNS server, and configure 1:1 NAT."}
{"input": "What is an example of configuring NAT on the Lock?", "output": "Before enabling NAT, the Lock is reachable at IP 172.23.58.52, and one LAN device is at 192.168.1.18. After NAT configuration, the Lock is still reachable at 172.23.58.52, but the LAN device is now at 10.10.10.18. This allows both Locks to connect simultaneously without issues, with the LAN device's IP address being translated via NAT."}
{"input": "What is HUB access rights management with Access Groups?", "output": "HUB access rights management in Tosibox is a way to manage user access within a network, using the Tosibox HUB. It centralizes control of access rights across various network devices, offering more efficient management as the network scales. Initially, access rights are managed through Tosibox Key, suitable for smaller networks, but as more devices and users are added, the HUB becomes necessary to manage access rights."}
{"input": "What is Access Rights Management?", "output": "Access rights management in Tosibox allows administrators to control user permissions and device access in a network. It can be done through the Tosibox Key for small networks or through HUB’s Access Groups for larger, more complex networks. The HUB centralizes the access control and makes it easier to manage as more devices and users are added to the network."}
{"input": "What is an Access Groups?", "output": "Access Groups in Tosibox HUB allow for the management of access rights across devices in a network. These are similar to an Access Control List (ACL) and help determine who can access which devices on the Locks' LAN side. It also allows for the organization of devices and users into groups to control permissions."}
{"input": "What is the Access Groups UI?", "output": "The Access Groups UI in Tosibox HUB is divided into two sections. The left side displays Keys and Locks, where administrators can select between Keys or Locks. The right side displays the created Access Groups. Users can filter, search, and manage groups and devices within the interface, with options to add new groups or items to an Access Group."}
{"input": "What is the workflow for creating Access Groups?", "output": "The workflow for creating Access Groups involves three steps: 1) Create a Lock group or Key group, selecting from the available Keys or Locks. 2) Define the Access Group by adding these groups into a new Access Group. 3) Edit the Access Group settings and finalize by saving the changes. Devices and users can be added or removed from Access Groups as needed."}
{"input": "What are the settings for Access Groups?", "output": "Access Group settings include options such as the group name, the number of Keys and Locks included, the physical interface or VLAN associated with the group, and default settings for new devices added. You can edit these settings or delete the group, although deletion is permanent and cannot be undone."}
{"input": "What is scheduled access in Access Groups?", "output": "Scheduled access in Access Groups allows administrators to limit access to certain devices based on a schedule. Sub Keys can only connect during scheduled times, and if they try to access outside of this window, access is disabled, with a notification displayed to the user. This feature helps control network access more granularly."}
{"input": "How do you activate scheduled access in Access Groups?", "output": "Scheduled access is activated by editing an existing Access Group or creating a new one. Administrators can define rules for Sub Keys, with multiple schedules supported for one Access Group. These rules can be enabled or disabled with a single click, and any changes made will take effect immediately without interrupting active connections."}
{"input": "What makes Tosibox secure?", "output": "TOSIBOX is ISO 27001 certified, showing that security is our cornerstone when developing and building OT networks.

{"input": "How does the remote connection work in Tosibox?", "output": "Tosibox devices establish secure connections via a VPN, using a unique matching process. The connection is authenticated and encrypted, with no intermediary server decrypting the data."}
{"input": "What is HUB remote logging?", "output": "Remote logging enables the transmission of audit events to an external server for centralized storage and analysis. This capability improves real-time monitoring, troubleshooting, and security maintenance throughout your network infrastructure. The main advantage is centralizing security auditing and enhancing incident response by retaining long-term audit logs."}
{"input": "What is the architecture of HUB remote logging?", "output": "HUB generates audit log events and saves them in a local database, creating an audit trail of individual events in the network. The events are stored locally for browsing via the HUB Web UI or can be forwarded to a remote server."}
{"input": "What is the user interface for HUB remote logging?", "output": "Remote Logging can be configured via the Settings → Remote Logging menu. The configuration requires the IP address of the remote log server, the remote port, and the network protocol (UDP, TCP, or TCP with TLS). If using TCP with TLS, cryptographic certificates and keys are required."}
{"input": "What security measures are involved in HUB remote logging?", "output": "UDP and TCP protocols are not secure, but TCP with TLS provides end-to-end encryption. This method encrypts the message using robust cryptography, ensuring information confidentiality and integrity. It is the recommended option for secure data transmission."}
{"input": "What is the TCP with TLS configuration for HUB remote logging?", "output": "To configure TCP with TLS, the TLS CA certificate from the remote end and the TLS certificate and key for the HUB instance are required.

{"input": "Give me an Introduction on WAN priority", "output": "WAN priority is a Lock feature that allows configuring several redundant Internet connections that protect the Lock connectivity. If currently used connectivity goes down there is a fallback connection that takes over. The number of available priorities can vary depending on the model. Consult data sheet to confirm this. Note that cellular connectivity between SIM slot 1 and SIM slot 2 cannot be configured with WAN priority."}
{"input": "How to use WAN priority", "output": "Several redundant Internet connections can be used in the Lock: WAN (fixed Ethernet, all models), WLAN (WiFi), USB modem, Internal modem. One of the connections can be selected as the main connection, and the other connections can be set as fallback connections. In the event that the main connection is interrupted, the connection is automatically switched to preselected backup connection according to the priority setting (e.g., WAN > WLAN > Internal Modem). The connection is switched back to the main connection once it is available again. Downtime during the switch over is few seconds at best, connectivity is switched immediately to backup connection when network loss is detected on the main connection."}
{"input": "How to Configure WAN priority", "output": "To take WAN priority in use, open the Lock’s management interface and log in as admin user. Go to Network > WAN priority to open the WAN priority page. By default, WAN priority is not configured. To setup priorities, configure the 1. WAN connection, 2. WAN connection and 3. WAN connection as needed, for example as in the screenshot below. If you are using WLAN or an external modem, make sure the connection methods have been configured correctly and the connections actually work before using them as fallback. Make also sure each WAN connection is set to a different connection. Otherwise, fallback is not in use. Other settings on WAN Priority page determine when the connection is considered dead. In a typical scenario, these need not be changed. Always test after changing the settings to ensure they are correct. To test WAN priorities, unplug the Ethernet cable or unscrew the WLAN and modem antennas to see connectivity change."}
{"input": "What are the two ways to set up a Tosibox Lock in the company network?", "output": "There are two ways to set up the network: 1. Lock in gateway mode (default): The Lock is connected to the company network from its WAN port and the remote users can only access the devices in the Lock’s own protected LAN network. Access to company network is not allowed for remote users. 2. Lock in client mode: The Lock is connected to the company network from its LAN port and the administrator can choose which parts or addresses of the company network are accessible for the remote users. These access rights restrictions are defined by enabling the IP/MAC filter feature on the Lock."}
{"input": "How does the Lock work in gateway mode?", "output": "In gateway mode, the Lock is connected to the company network from its WAN port and the remote users can only access the devices in the Lock’s own protected LAN network. Access to the company network is not allowed for remote users."}
{"input": "How does the Lock work in client mode?", "output": "In client mode, the Lock is connected to the company network from its LAN port and the administrator can choose which parts or addresses of the company network are accessible for the remote users. These access rights restrictions are defined by enabling the IP/MAC filter feature on the Lock. The access rights can be defined separately for each remote user if needed."}
{"input": "Does the installation require any special configuration or firewall changes?", "output": "Typically, no special configuration or firewall changes are required. If the company network has internet access, remote access with the Tosibox Lock will work. Tosibox is firewall and NAT friendly and usually does not require opening any ports on the company firewall for the VPN connection to work."}
{"input": "Can the communication be further restricted in the company network?", "output": "Yes, with the Lock’s different settings, it is also possible to further restrict communication within the company network. For example, connections from the Lock’s LAN network towards the Internet can be blocked, or VPN connections from the Internet can be blocked or only allowed during a certain time period."}

{"input": "How to change LAN IP address space settings", "output": "If you need to make changes to LAN IP address space on the Lock, it is recommended you do so locally from the Service port. If you change these settings remotely, after saving the new settings the device needs to be rebooted on-site. Connecting device(s) with Fixed IP addresses by configuring the LOCK to the DEVICE: 1. Get the device(s’) IP address(es) and netmask. 2. Connect your PC to the Lock’s service port and log in following the step 1 on page 17 “Updating the Lock software”. 3. Go to Network -> LAN and change the IP address in the “IPv4 address” field to the next IP address above the IP address of the device (step 1). Also check that the “IPv4 netmask” field corresponds to the netmask set on the device and change it if necessary. 4. Plug the device(s) into the Lock’s LAN port(s) and go! 5. ADVANCED/ENTERPRISE USERS ONLY: Go to Network -> LAN DHCP SERVER and set the “Start” value so that it’s higher than all used static addresses. Set the limit value to a suitable value so that it covers the rest of the unused addresses in the LAN range. For example, the range 192.168.5.50 – 192.168.5.254 contains 205 addresses so the “Start” value would be 50 and the “Limit” value would be 205."}

Modbus can be used to query and set Node configuration options from LAN devices. LAN device executing the query can then relay the data forward for example to a SCADA supervisory system."}
{"input": "How to Configure the Node and the Modbus", "output": "Enabling and configuring Modbus is done on the Advanced Settings page in the Web UI. Settings: • Enable Modbus server - When enabled Modbus server is started and Node is listening to client requests • Listen IP - IP address that the Node accepts Modbus requests from. Use 0.0.0.0 if all addresses should be accepted • Master for Internet/VPN access states - When enabled overrides digital I/O settings, when disabled digital I/O will override possible Modbus commands. In both cases Modbus overrides UI settings always. Applies to Internet access enabled and VPN access enabled commands. After enabling the Modbus server it listens on port 502 on WLAN access point and all physical LAN interfaces. Modbus data update rate is around 10 seconds. If Modbus clients ask data rarely (e.g. once a minute), first query may yield 0xFFFF value. Client must wait a few seconds and ask again. Modbus uses simple TCP/IP request-response protocol, it does not have connected/disconnected states. If a Modbus client goes offline Modbus server on the Node will not be notified. Node keeps the last state that was set until explicitly changed."}

{"input": "How to perform initial setup on HUB?", "output": "Accessing the configuration interface: Start the virtual machine that was installed in the previous step. The virtual machine will automatically boot into graphical console / desktop and launch the activation user interface through a browser. The browser will automatically close after it has been inactive for a long time. In this case it can be restarted by interacting on the desktop with mouse or keyboard. WAN interface configuration and product activation: In the activation user interface, configure the IP address settings for the WAN interface. The IP address has to be assigned dynamically with DHCP during activation. After activation is complete, you can configure IP address manually. When configuring the IP address manually, it is very important to enter also working DNS servers as many product features, including the activation, require a working DNS service. Enter the delivered license key into its own field and click Activate. The product will be now activated and it will download rest of the product components using the defined WAN connection. This can take up to 15 minutes, depending on the Internet connection speed. After the activation and installation is finalized, a message 'Activation completed, rebooting...' will appear and the VM will automatically reboot. After reboot, you can proceed with the configuration."}

{"input": "What is HTTPS login?", "output": "HTTPS is essential for securing web UI logins, protecting user data, and maintaining the integrity and trustworthiness of the login process. It's considered a best practice and is increasingly becoming the standard for all web communications, not just those involving sensitive data. HTTPS benefits: Encrypts data transmitted between the client and server. Uses cryptographic algorithms to ensure data hasn't been tampered with in transit. Provides server authentication through SSL/TLS certificates. Often required for compliance with data protection regulations (e.g., NIS2). HUB web UI access can be made via secure https protocol. Https encrypts traffic between the end user device and the web server and thus provides increased security. Default protocol is http. If https is enabled, it is always used when accessing web UI from the HUB LAN or over VPN connection."}
{"input": "What is Self-signed certificate?", "output": "HUB https implementation relies on self-signed certificates. Https using self-signed certificate is equally secure, but since the security certificate is generated and signed by the HUB itself the web browser cannot know whether a certificate can be relied on and it typically shows a warning “Your connection is not private”. To access the web UI, you must tell your browser the server is reliable and that the certificate can be trusted. You do this by clicking “Proceed to <address>” or similar button shown on the web browser."}
{"input": "What are HUB static routes?", "output": "A 'static route' in networking refers to a predefined and manually configured path that data packets should follow to reach a specific network or destination. Static routes are manually set by network administrators to specify the next-hop router or gateway that should be used to reach the destination network. Unlike dynamic routing protocols that automatically determine the best path, static routes are configured and maintained manually. Static routes are used when a network environment is simple, stable, and changes rarely."}
{"input": "What is the static routes view in HUB?", "output": "HUB static routes view can be configured with the Network / Static routes menu command. The view consists of two tables: the Active IPv4 Routes table and the Static IPv4 Routes table. The Active IPv4 Routes table lists default routes, active static routes already in the system, and routes related to VPNs. The Static IPv4 Routes table allows for new routes to be defined and edited. HUB will notify if a route conflicts with predefined system routes or if a gateway is not reachable."}
