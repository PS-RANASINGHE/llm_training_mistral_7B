{"input": "How to set up 1:1 NAT on Lock", "output": "Network address translation (NAT) is a method of remapping one IP address space into another by modifying network address information in the IP header of packets while they are in transit across a traffic routing device. In practice this means using the same IP address range in multiple sites and remapping the addresses in Locks so that the sites appear to have different addresses on the Key side.\nThere are two types of NAT techniques; one-to-one NAT and one-to-many NAT. One-to-one NAT maps one LAN device address to another, each LAN device having their own private address and one-to-many NAT maps all LAN devices to the one and the same IP address. Tosibox Lock supports one-to-one NAT and this is where we focus from now on.\n\n**When to use NAT**\n\n**Issue example**\n\n**Configuring NAT**\nTo configure NAT open the Lock’s management interface and log in as admin user. Go to Network > LAN to open LAN configuration page. Take NAT into use by selecting the Use translated addresses with remote access (1:1 NAT) checkbox."}

Through remote logging configuration, you can guarantee that crucial system events and audit trails are stored securely off-device, creating a dependable record for forensic analysis, security inquiries, and compliance reporting.\n\n**Architecture**\nHUB generates audit log events and saves them in local database creating an audit trail of individual events in the network. Administrator can access the audit log via HUB Web UI. In a larger network possibly with several HUBs and other network devices audit log events database can grow large and it often is useful to send the events to a remote server.\n\n**User interface**\nRemote Logging can be configured with the Settings → Remote Logging menu command.\n\n**Security**\nUDP and TCP protocols alone are not secure, there are numerous methods to intercept and eavesdrop on messages. TCP with TLS is the recommended option in most cases."}

The technology is based on globally acknowledged information encryption standards, secure user authentication, automatic security updates and simplifying often complex technology."}
{"input": "What is Tosibox key?", "output": "Tosibox Key is an intelligent USB-connected device that contains a secure crypto-processor. The Key is used to establish a secure connection to the edge Node. All Tosibox Keys and edge Nodes are interoperable. Tosibox Key can be a Master Key that is the top authority to manage the network access rights for other Key user. Key users can be software only Keys, hardware Keys or Mobile Client users. Tosibox Node is a device that accepts remote connections from Keys and creates private and secure access to connected network devices. The network devices that are connected to the Node´s LAN port are automatically discovered. Node can also be connected together to expand a single network to multiple sites. When connecting two Nodes to each other, one must be in Sub Lock mode of operation where the Node is a subordinate to its master Node. Tosibox HUB is a VPN tunnel concentrator that maintains always-on VPN connections towards Tosibox Nodes and provides centralized user and network management."}
{"input": "What is Device Identities", "output": "Tosibox products identify each other by cryptographic pairing in which the products are matched with each other before use. This is achieved locally by connecting the Tosibox Node with the user Key physically, or remotely by generating the Remote Matching Code on the device that is to be matched."}
{"input": "What happens during the physical matching process?", "output": "In the physical matching process, the Key device is inserted into the USB port of the edge Node. In Remote Matching the device that is to be matched generates a cryptographic code that can be entered in the Key SW. In the matching process, the edge Node and Key exchange public key of the keypair with each other to create a mutual trust relationship. The encryption key is stored in a closed memory location of the crypto processor on the Key device. The encryption key is protected with a password even if you lose the Key device. The encryption key cannot be copied or tampered with by outsiders. Establishing a remote connection to the edge Node is impossible without the correct encryption key."}
{"input": "Key Connection", "output": "Every user Key uses either a bridged Layer 2 or a routed Layer 3 connection. The Layer 2 connection type means that the edge Node is essentially in the same network with the user that it is bridged to. A Layer 3 creates a routed connection where the Lock and User have their own IP networks. The bridged Key connection allows access only to a specific LAN network and the Locks bridged to it. The routed Key connection allows the selection of multiple LAN networks, Locks and other targets that are accessible for the Key."}
{"input": "How does Tosibox establish VPN connections?", "output": "Typically, Tosibox edge Node and Key can establish the VPN connection directly between each other using the UDP protocol. There are, however, some cases where this is not possible, for example when outbound UDP is blocked in the firewall, or a proxy server must be used. In these situations, the VPN connection is established using a fallback mechanism using the TCP protocol, with the help of a relay server. The relay server is a Tosibox maintained router on the Internet that re-routes the encrypted VPN data between the connection end points. At no point is the data decrypted at any server because the connections are still end-to-end authenticated and encrypted."}
{"input": "Why should outbound UDP connections be allowed in the firewall?", "output": "Because of the latencies between Tosibox products and the relay servers, the nature of the TCP protocol, and server capacity, relayed connections may not provide as good performance as direct UDP connections. To avoid this situation and to ensure the best performance, all outbound UDP connections should be allowed in the firewall."}
{"input": "Remote Connection", "output": "Tosibox edge Node and Key identify each other reliably over the Internet because of the matching connection described previously. This unique and patented method by Tosibox creates the connection securely and automatically even through firewalls and NATs. The connection doesn’t require any inbound ports to be permanently open on the firewall. Required outbound ports are listed in the table at the end of this document."}
{"input": "Key - Node connection establishment steps", "output": "1. Key and edge Node register themselves to the MatchMaker service. The connection between the MatchMaker and TOSIBOX devices is encrypted using TLS and mutually authenticated using certificates and PKI 2. User initiates the Key software to request a connection to the edge Node. MatchMaker service listens for connection requests and redirects the connection parameters to the respective end points 3. VPN tunnel is mutually authenticated between the Key software and the edge Node using certificates and PKI 4. VPN tunnel is established directly between the Tosibox edge Node and Key. The connection is end-to-end authenticated and encrypted. Encryption and decryption take place at the connection end points"}
{"input": "How to access Tosibox devices remotely over the Internet", "output": "The only way to access Tosibox devices remotely over the Internet is by using the private, secure and encrypted VPN connection that TOSIBOX creates. Having Tosibox secure connection to the remote site does not cause data security issues to the users or the remote network if the software is kept up to date and access control and system settings are reviewed and maintained systematically."}
{"input": "How are Tosibox HUB and edge Node configuration UIs protected?", "output": "Tosibox HUB and edge Node configuration UIs are protected from unauthorized users with a username/password. Login is possible only over VPN connection if accessing from the internet or via private LAN side."}
{"input": "What does Tosibox Key provide for remote access?", "output": "Remote access to the network requires Tosibox Key and explicit access rights granted by the network administrator. Tosibox Key provides 2-Factor Authentication, the Key hardware device and a user defined password for login."}
{"input": "Local connection in Tosibox", "output": "Tosibox edge Node and user Key can also be used in closed, high security networks to further protect critical systems. In closed networks the Tosibox products connect directly to each other without the need of an internet connection. In addition, connection made outside the network as well as remote connections originating from outside of that closed network can be blocked. This feature is called Local Connection."}
{"input": "Mobile Client Security", "output": "Tosibox Mobile Client for Android and for iOS also adheres to the same high security standards and builds on the physical security foundation of Tosibox. Access rights are granted and controlled from the physical Key device, keeping the Key owner always in control – even if the mobile device would get lost. The Mobile Client utilizes a two-factor authentication scheme where the security credentials are tied to the physical mobile device. The application cannot be copied to or used on another device. Additionally, it is possible to prevent access from Mobile Clients completely per edge Node by the administrator."}

Activation involves generating an activation code on the master Key, sending it to the end user, who then activates the SoftKey client. Once activated, you can define access rights and start using the SoftKey to connect to Locks."}
{"input": "What is Lock mode?", "output": "In Lock Mode, the Lock acts as a combined router/firewall on the network. The Lock is connected to the Internet via its WAN port or a 4G modem. It creates its own protected local network for the connected devices. Devices that are connected to the Lock by cable or via WLAN access point are accessible with the Key."}
{"input": "What is Client mode?", "output": "In Client Mode, the Lock acts as a client, not as a router/firewall. It provides secure remote access to the network but does not protect devices connected to the same LAN. The Lock is connected to an existing network like any other device and provides remote users access to other devices in the network. The Lock can be considered as a network switch, not routing traffic between WAN and LAN."}
{"input": "What is the difference between Lock mode and Client mode?", "output": "Lock Mode creates its own protected local network and acts as a router/firewall, whereas Client Mode connects to an existing network and acts as a client, providing remote access but not network protection."}
{"input": "What are the requirements to set the Lock in Client mode?", "output": "In Client mode, the Lock must be connected to the network through a LAN port. The WAN port is not used in Client Mode. The Lock must have a fixed IP address or DHCP Client configuration, and NAT can be enabled."}
{"input": "What should I check if my Key can't connect to Lock?", "output": "If you can't see Lock in Key user interface or if Lock is red, check these: 1. Key has Internet connection. 2. Key is serialized to Lock. 3. Lock has Internet connection."}
{"input": "What if the Lock is yellow in the Key software user interface but I can't connect to it?", "output": "If the Lock is yellow in Key user interface but you cannot connect to it, check the following: 1. Layer 2 Key needs to have assigned IP address or at least Lock's DHCP server on. 2. Firewall does not block the connection."}
{"input": "What if the connection still doesn't work after checking the above points?", "output": "If the connection still doesn't work, try using a different Internet connection for Key. If that still doesn't resolve the issue, enable remote support for Lock and contact Tosibox Support."}
{"input": "When to use Layer 2 or Layer 3?", "output": "Tosibox remote connections support two different connection types: Layer 2 (bridged) and Layer 3 (routed). Layer 2 connection creates a virtual network interface that appears to be residing in the remote network, where each remote user gets its own address from the remote network. It works on the data link layer (MAC). Layer 3 connection has tunnel end points with private addresses, and data is routed to the remote network via the remote end of the tunnel. Traffic in the remote network appears to be coming from the Lock device without needing additional addresses. It works on the network layer (Internet Protocol)."}
{"input": "What are key connections for Layer 2?", "output": "Use Layer 2 when the application uses a non-IP protocol on top of Ethernet (e.g. Profinet or IPv6), the application relies on broadcast functionality (e.g., in discovery of certain IP cameras), or when connections originating from Lock’s network to the Key computer are needed."}
{"input": "What are key connections for Layer 3?", "output": "Use Layer 3 when allocating an IP address for each remote user from the remote network is not desired, when connecting to a Central Lock that has Layer 3 connections to Locks, or when the Lock has 1:1 NAT enabled and connections should use the translated addresses. Layer 3 is usually more efficient and less prone to DHCP problems."}
{"input": "What is a HUB – Lock connection?", "output": "When serializing a Lock to a HUB, the connection type can be chosen between Layer 2 (Sub Lock) and Layer 3 (Lock). Layer 3 (Lock) connection is recommended in most HUB deployments as it scales better. Any Key with Layer 3 connection type that can connect to the Central Lock can also connect to devices behind Layer 3-connected Locks. Layer 2 (Sub Lock) connection requires that keys connect through the HUB, and the devices behind the Sub Lock will access the Internet via the HUB."}
{"input": "How can I install the Tosibox Mobile Client on Android?", "output": "You can download and install the Tosibox Mobile Client from Google Play using the following link: https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.tosibox.mobileclient. Alternatively, you can visit https://www.tosibox.com/for-user-tosibox-mobileclient for more information."}
{"input": "What is 1:1 NAT on Lock?", "output": "Network address translation (NAT) is a method of remapping one IP address space into another by modifying network address information in the IP header of packets while they are in transit across a traffic routing device. It allows using the same IP address range in multiple sites and remapping the addresses in Locks so that the sites appear to have different addresses on the Key side. One-to-one NAT maps one LAN device address to another."}
{"input": "When should you use NAT?", "output": "NAT should be used when you need to connect multiple sites simultaneously and cannot configure each site individually. This occurs when the same IP addresses are used in each site, causing connection issues. The solution to this is 1:1 NAT, which can resolve IP address conflicts and allow simultaneous connections."}
{"input": "How do you configure NAT on the Lock?", "output": "To configure NAT, open the Lock's management interface and log in as an admin. Go to Network > LAN, then select the 'Use translated addresses with remote access (1:1 NAT)' checkbox. You can configure the translated address or let the Lock decide. After saving the settings, the Lock will disconnect remote access and reconfigure your workstation."}
{"input": "What is the 'Lock in Lock mode' configuration?", "output": "In Lock mode, NAT is configured through Network > LAN settings. For example, if the Lock's LAN IP is 10.15.6.1 with a netmask of 255.255.255.0, and a device on that network is 10.15.6.2, enabling NAT will allow the Lock to designate a new NAT IP network address (e.g., 10.1.1.0). From the Key side, the Lock user interface can be accessed via the NAT IP (e.g., 10.1.1.1), and LAN devices will use NAT addresses."}
{"input": "What is the 'Lock in Client mode' configuration?", "output": "In Client mode, NAT can be configured through the Lock's Network > LAN settings. This mode does not use a physical WAN connection, only a physical LAN connection. DHCP on the LAN won't work, only static IP addressing is supported. You must assign a static IP address, subnet, gateway IP address, DNS server, and configure 1:1 NAT."}
{"input": "What is an example of configuring NAT on the Lock?", "output": "Before enabling NAT, the Lock is reachable at IP 172.23.58.52, and one LAN device is at 192.168.1.18. After NAT configuration, the Lock is still reachable at 172.23.58.52, but the LAN device is now at 10.10.10.18. This allows both Locks to connect simultaneously without issues, with the LAN device's IP address being translated via NAT."}
{"input": "What is HUB access rights management with Access Groups?", "output": "HUB access rights management in Tosibox is a way to manage user access within a network, using the Tosibox HUB. It centralizes control of access rights across various network devices, offering more efficient management as the network scales. Initially, access rights are managed through Tosibox Key, suitable for smaller networks, but as more devices and users are added, the HUB becomes necessary to manage access rights."}
{"input": "What is Access Rights Management?", "output": "Access rights management in Tosibox allows administrators to control user permissions and device access in a network. It can be done through the Tosibox Key for small networks or through HUB’s Access Groups for larger, more complex networks. The HUB centralizes the access control and makes it easier to manage as more devices and users are added to the network."}
{"input": "What is an Access Groups?", "output": "Access Groups in Tosibox HUB allow for the management of access rights across devices in a network. These are similar to an Access Control List (ACL) and help determine who can access which devices on the Locks' LAN side. It also allows for the organization of devices and users into groups to control permissions."}
{"input": "What is the Access Groups UI?", "output": "The Access Groups UI in Tosibox HUB is divided into two sections. The left side displays Keys and Locks, where administrators can select between Keys or Locks. The right side displays the created Access Groups. Users can filter, search, and manage groups and devices within the interface, with options to add new groups or items to an Access Group."}
{"input": "What is the workflow for creating Access Groups?", "output": "The workflow for creating Access Groups involves three steps: 1) Create a Lock group or Key group, selecting from the available Keys or Locks. 2) Define the Access Group by adding these groups into a new Access Group. 3) Edit the Access Group settings and finalize by saving the changes. Devices and users can be added or removed from Access Groups as needed."}
{"input": "What are the settings for Access Groups?", "output": "Access Group settings include options such as the group name, the number of Keys and Locks included, the physical interface or VLAN associated with the group, and default settings for new devices added. You can edit these settings or delete the group, although deletion is permanent and cannot be undone."}
{"input": "What is scheduled access in Access Groups?", "output": "Scheduled access in Access Groups allows administrators to limit access to certain devices based on a schedule. Sub Keys can only connect during scheduled times, and if they try to access outside of this window, access is disabled, with a notification displayed to the user. This feature helps control network access more granularly."}
{"input": "How do you activate scheduled access in Access Groups?", "output": "Scheduled access is activated by editing an existing Access Group or creating a new one. Administrators can define rules for Sub Keys, with multiple schedules supported for one Access Group. These rules can be enabled or disabled with a single click, and any changes made will take effect immediately without interrupting active connections."}
{"input": "What makes Tosibox secure?", "output": "TOSIBOX is ISO 27001 certified, showing that security is our cornerstone when developing and building OT networks. Our solution secures your sites, identifies users, and encrypts all traffic within the network, addressing cybersecurity at every step."}
{"input": "How does Tosibox ensure secure communication between devices?", "output": "TOSIBOX products identify each other by cryptographic pairing, where the user Key is matched with the Node before use, creating a trust relationship between them."}
{"input": "What encryption methods are used in Tosibox's VPN?", "output": "When the VPN remote connection is established, the information is encrypted and decrypted only at the connection end points (devices). Tosibox ensures that no one, not even Tosibox itself, can decrypt the data in between."}
{"input": "Does Tosibox store private keys or passwords?", "output": "Tosibox does not retain any private keys or passwords for the products. Our technical support can gain remote access only after the user has explicitly turned on the remote support feature."}
{"input": "What is Tosibox's approach to two-factor authentication?", "output": "Two-factor authentication involves verifying multiple properties of the client logging in: the physical TOSIBOX Key or Mobile Client device (something the user has) and the password for the network or device management UI (something the user knows)."}
{"input": "Which cryptographic technologies are used by Tosibox?", "output": "Tosibox uses industry standard technologies like the RSA cryptosystem, AES 256 encryption, Diffie–Hellman key exchange, and TLS sessions."}
{"input": "What is the Plug&Go feature of Tosibox?", "output": "Plug&Go means that using Tosibox products from box to operation takes only a few minutes and requires no special IT skills, reducing the risk of misconfiguration."}

{"input": "How does Tosibox manage device authentication?", "output": "TOSIBOX products identify each other by cryptographic pairing. The user Key is matched with the Node before use, and the devices exchange public keys to create a trust relationship."}
{"input": "What happens if the Tosibox Key is lost?", "output": "The encryption key stored in the Key device is protected with a password, even if you lose the Key. The encryption key cannot be copied or tampered with by outsiders."}
{"input": "How does the remote connection work in Tosibox?", "output": "Tosibox devices establish secure connections via a VPN, using a unique matching process. The connection is authenticated and encrypted, with no intermediary server decrypting the data."}
{"input": "What is HUB remote logging?", "output": "Remote logging enables the transmission of audit events to an external server for centralized storage and analysis. This capability improves real-time monitoring, troubleshooting, and security maintenance throughout your network infrastructure. The main advantage is centralizing security auditing and enhancing incident response by retaining long-term audit logs."}
{"input": "What is the architecture of HUB remote logging?", "output": "HUB generates audit log events and saves them in a local database, creating an audit trail of individual events in the network. The events are stored locally for browsing via the HUB Web UI or can be forwarded to a remote server."}
{"input": "What is the user interface for HUB remote logging?", "output": "Remote Logging can be configured via the Settings → Remote Logging menu. The configuration requires the IP address of the remote log server, the remote port, and the network protocol (UDP, TCP, or TCP with TLS). If using TCP with TLS, cryptographic certificates and keys are required."}
{"input": "What security measures are involved in HUB remote logging?", "output": "UDP and TCP protocols are not secure, but TCP with TLS provides end-to-end encryption. This method encrypts the message using robust cryptography, ensuring information confidentiality and integrity. It is the recommended option for secure data transmission."}
{"input": "What is the TCP with TLS configuration for HUB remote logging?", "output": "To configure TCP with TLS, the TLS CA certificate from the remote end and the TLS certificate and key for the HUB instance are required. These certificates should be entered into the Web UI. The TLS version is automatically negotiated, with TLS 1.3 taking priority if supported by both ends."}
{"input": "How can I test the connection for HUB remote logging?", "output": "HUB provides a Test logserver connection button to validate connectivity settings. If validation is successful, it attempts to establish a connection to the configured remote server. A test event can also be generated to verify the message delivery and parsing."}
{"input": "What is the message format used in HUB remote logging?", "output": "The message format is based on CEF (Common Event Format), which uses UTF-8 Unicode encoding. A message consists of three sections: Syslog header fields, CEF mandatory fields, and CEF extension fields. CEF is text-based and easy to parse, making it suitable for centralized logging systems."}
{"input": "How to onboard a network to TosiControl?", "output": "To onboard a network on TosiControl, follow these straightforward steps. It’s important to note that you will need to use your master key for this process, and you must be the owner of the organization as listed in the ServiceNow portal. Upon logging into TosiControl for the first time, you will encounter a blank window with no entries under Total Networks, Total Hubs and Locks, and just one account listed under Users. This initial setup allows you to begin the onboarding process effectively."}
{"input": "What is a Network in TosiControl?", "output": "In TosiControl, a network refers to a TOSIBOX environment that is fundamentally governed by a master key. This master key acts as the essential seed for the network, establishing secure connections and enabling management capabilities for all devices within that environment."}

{"input": "Give me an Introduction on WAN priority", "output": "WAN priority is a Lock feature that allows configuring several redundant Internet connections that protect the Lock connectivity. If currently used connectivity goes down there is a fallback connection that takes over. The number of available priorities can vary depending on the model. Consult data sheet to confirm this. Note that cellular connectivity between SIM slot 1 and SIM slot 2 cannot be configured with WAN priority."}
{"input": "How to use WAN priority", "output": "Several redundant Internet connections can be used in the Lock: WAN (fixed Ethernet, all models), WLAN (WiFi), USB modem, Internal modem. One of the connections can be selected as the main connection, and the other connections can be set as fallback connections. In the event that the main connection is interrupted, the connection is automatically switched to preselected backup connection according to the priority setting (e.g., WAN > WLAN > Internal Modem). The connection is switched back to the main connection once it is available again. Downtime during the switch over is few seconds at best, connectivity is switched immediately to backup connection when network loss is detected on the main connection."}
{"input": "How to Configure WAN priority", "output": "To take WAN priority in use, open the Lock’s management interface and log in as admin user. Go to Network > WAN priority to open the WAN priority page. By default, WAN priority is not configured. To setup priorities, configure the 1. WAN connection, 2. WAN connection and 3. WAN connection as needed, for example as in the screenshot below. If you are using WLAN or an external modem, make sure the connection methods have been configured correctly and the connections actually work before using them as fallback. Make also sure each WAN connection is set to a different connection. Otherwise, fallback is not in use. Other settings on WAN Priority page determine when the connection is considered dead. In a typical scenario, these need not be changed. Always test after changing the settings to ensure they are correct. To test WAN priorities, unplug the Ethernet cable or unscrew the WLAN and modem antennas to see connectivity change."}
{"input": "What are the two ways to set up a Tosibox Lock in the company network?", "output": "There are two ways to set up the network: 1. Lock in gateway mode (default): The Lock is connected to the company network from its WAN port and the remote users can only access the devices in the Lock’s own protected LAN network. Access to company network is not allowed for remote users. 2. Lock in client mode: The Lock is connected to the company network from its LAN port and the administrator can choose which parts or addresses of the company network are accessible for the remote users. These access rights restrictions are defined by enabling the IP/MAC filter feature on the Lock."}
{"input": "How does the Lock work in gateway mode?", "output": "In gateway mode, the Lock is connected to the company network from its WAN port and the remote users can only access the devices in the Lock’s own protected LAN network. Access to the company network is not allowed for remote users."}
{"input": "How does the Lock work in client mode?", "output": "In client mode, the Lock is connected to the company network from its LAN port and the administrator can choose which parts or addresses of the company network are accessible for the remote users. These access rights restrictions are defined by enabling the IP/MAC filter feature on the Lock. The access rights can be defined separately for each remote user if needed."}
{"input": "Does the installation require any special configuration or firewall changes?", "output": "Typically, no special configuration or firewall changes are required. If the company network has internet access, remote access with the Tosibox Lock will work. Tosibox is firewall and NAT friendly and usually does not require opening any ports on the company firewall for the VPN connection to work."}
{"input": "Can the communication be further restricted in the company network?", "output": "Yes, with the Lock’s different settings, it is also possible to further restrict communication within the company network. For example, connections from the Lock’s LAN network towards the Internet can be blocked, or VPN connections from the Internet can be blocked or only allowed during a certain time period."}

{"input": "How do you add a fixed IP address device into the Lock?", "output": "When adding a device with a fixed IP address, make sure that the device and the Lock have the same IP address space and netmask. For example, if the IP address of a fixed IP device is 192.168.0.150, and its netmask is 255.255.255.0, set the Lock's IP address as 192.168.0.1 and the netmask as 255.255.255.0. The Lock's settings can be changed from Network > Interfaces > LAN. Alternatively, change the network settings of the fixed IP address device to match the Lock's settings. To add a device with a fixed IP address to the Network Devices list of the Lock 100, log in as admin, go to Network Devices, click New Network Device, and add the device info on the page. For the Lock 200, log in as admin, hover over 'Network Devices' on the status page, click 'Add new device', and add the device info."}
{"input": "How to add static routes to Lock", "output": "If you need access via the Key to another network or a specific device on a network connected to Lock’s LAN network, you can define static routes to the Lock. To add a static route, go to Network > Static routes, click 'Add', select interface 'lan' from the dropdown list, give the IP address (e.g., 192.168.100.5), netmask (e.g., 255.255.255.255), and gateway (e.g., 10.1.0.10), and click 'Save'."}
{"input": "How to change LAN IP address space settings", "output": "If you need to make changes to LAN IP address space on the Lock, it is recommended you do so locally from the Service port. If you change these settings remotely, after saving the new settings the device needs to be rebooted on-site. Connecting device(s) with Fixed IP addresses by configuring the LOCK to the DEVICE: 1. Get the device(s’) IP address(es) and netmask. 2. Connect your PC to the Lock’s service port and log in following the step 1 on page 17 “Updating the Lock software”. 3. Go to Network -> LAN and change the IP address in the “IPv4 address” field to the next IP address above the IP address of the device (step 1). Also check that the “IPv4 netmask” field corresponds to the netmask set on the device and change it if necessary. 4. Plug the device(s) into the Lock’s LAN port(s) and go! 5. ADVANCED/ENTERPRISE USERS ONLY: Go to Network -> LAN DHCP SERVER and set the “Start” value so that it’s higher than all used static addresses. Set the limit value to a suitable value so that it covers the rest of the unused addresses in the LAN range. For example, the range 192.168.5.50 – 192.168.5.254 contains 205 addresses so the “Start” value would be 50 and the “Limit” value would be 205."}
{"input": "How to enable remote support", "output": "Login to Lock or HUB management user interface with Key or from service port or from LAN network. Go to Settings -> Advanced settings -> mark 'Allow secure remote access for Tosibox Technical support', define remote support duration and click SAVE.

{"input": "How to use Modbus", "output": "Modbus is a communication protocol commonly used in industrial automation to facilitate the exchange of data between different devices, such as sensors, controllers, and actuators. Modbus can be used to query and set Node configuration options from LAN devices. LAN device executing the query can then relay the data forward for example to a SCADA supervisory system. Modbus has become a widely adopted standard in the industry. There are variants of the Modbus protocol of which Tosibox implementation support the Modbus TCP/IP. Modbus standard ensures interoperability and compatibility between devices from different manufacturers that support Modbus communication. Modbus is supported on Lock 150, 210, 250, 500 and Tosibox 175, 350, 375, 610, 650, 670, 675, 695 starting with firmware 5.5.0."}
{"input": "What is Modbus", "output": "Modbus is a communication protocol commonly used in industrial automation to facilitate the exchange of data between different devices, such as sensors, controllers, and actuators. Modbus can be used to query and set Node configuration options from LAN devices. LAN device executing the query can then relay the data forward for example to a SCADA supervisory system."}
{"input": "How to Configure the Node and the Modbus", "output": "Enabling and configuring Modbus is done on the Advanced Settings page in the Web UI. Settings: • Enable Modbus server - When enabled Modbus server is started and Node is listening to client requests • Listen IP - IP address that the Node accepts Modbus requests from. Use 0.0.0.0 if all addresses should be accepted • Master for Internet/VPN access states - When enabled overrides digital I/O settings, when disabled digital I/O will override possible Modbus commands. In both cases Modbus overrides UI settings always. Applies to Internet access enabled and VPN access enabled commands. After enabling the Modbus server it listens on port 502 on WLAN access point and all physical LAN interfaces. Modbus data update rate is around 10 seconds. If Modbus clients ask data rarely (e.g. once a minute), first query may yield 0xFFFF value. Client must wait a few seconds and ask again. Modbus uses simple TCP/IP request-response protocol, it does not have connected/disconnected states. If a Modbus client goes offline Modbus server on the Node will not be notified. Node keeps the last state that was set until explicitly changed."}
{"input": "What are the respective Registers available in Modbus", "output": "Data Data value Registers first - last relative to 40001 Return value if data is not available Comment GNSS latitude 64-bit IEEE-754 floating point (little-endian) 0 - 3 Registers: 4 NaN Returns 0xFFFF on devices without GNSS GNSS longitude 64-bit IEEE-754 floating point (little-endian) 4 - 7 Registers: 4 NaN Returns 0xFFFF on devices without GNSS GNSS UTC time, seconds since midnight 64-bit IEEE-754 floating point (little-endian) 8 - 11 Registers: 4 NaN GNSS data does not outdate, i.e. the latest info will be posted as long as there is no new coordinates.
